# weer9292
A simple weather app created for some nice guys at 9292, to check whether they can lunch outside without getting soaked

*Important note for the 9292 devs: run the Acceptance build to test the app (Debug uses mocked data and Release requires manual signing setup)*



## Setup
The Debug and acceptance builds can be run without additional setup.
Release builds require signing - so requires some additional manual setup - which is described [here](./docs/Signing.md)



## Documentation
Important info about the project's workflow and maintenance (like code style & automated testing) are described
[here](./docs/Workflow_And_Maintenance.md). ***Make sure to read these before working on this project!***
All other documentation under source control can be found [here](./docs).
